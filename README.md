# leaflet-challenge

This project visualizes recent earthquake data on an interactive map using Leaflet.js and D3.js. Earthquakes are displayed as color-coded circle markers, where the size represents magnitude and the color indicates depth.

Features:
Interactive Map displaying recent earthquakes.
Color-coded Markers based on earthquake depth.
Dynamic Legend showing depth ranges and colors.
Popups with earthquake details (location, magnitude, URL).

Resources:
Leaflet.js
D3.js
USGS Earthquake API
Tutoring
chatGPT
Class Activites
Leafletjs.com

Conclusion:
The earthquake visualization map offers valuable insights into earthquake patterns over time and across different regions. By displaying earthquake magnitudes and depths with interactive markers, users can quickly assess the intensity and distribution of seismic activity. The depth-based color coding helps identify whether earthquakes are shallow or deep, potentially correlating with different geological processes. This tool can be used for educational purposes, research, or real-time monitoring of earthquake activity.
